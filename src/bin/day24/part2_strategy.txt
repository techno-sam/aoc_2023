Use stone 1's frame of reference (so that it is stopped at the origin), such that any crossing the origin at any time works

Then:
form a plane through the origin and the line of stone 2's path
- use https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/m408m/Display12-5-4.shtml
- using vector A = (p_2 - ORIGIN) aka p_2 and vector B = (v_2) as the 'defining' vectors of the plane,
    the normal can be found as A x B (cross product)

find the time & place of intersection for stones 3 and 4, constructing a velocity and initial position from these
- use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-plane_intersection

transform said velocity & initial position back to the 'global' frame of reference

profit
